1. Data is already organized by date, making it possible to look through row by row.

2. My logic looks at the current row and compares it to the last one (<>) to see if we've found a new Ticker.
  a. If so, calculate data and print and format where appropriate.
  b. Meanwhile, store the greatest (of all time) values.
  
3. Print GOAT values before beginning a new iteration on the next Worksheet.
